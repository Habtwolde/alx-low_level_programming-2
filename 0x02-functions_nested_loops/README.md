# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
## Description
What you should learn from this project:

What are nested loops and how to use them, What is a function and how do you use functions, What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function, What is a prototype, Scope of variables, What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`, What are header files and how to to use them with `#include`.

* Write a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line:
    * **[0-putchar.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-putchar.c)**
* Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line:
    * **[1-alphabet.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-alphabet.c)**
* Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line:

* Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`:
    * **[3-name](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name)**
* Write a C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line:
    * **[4-puts.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)**
* Write a C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line:
    * **[5-printf.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)**
* Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on:
    * **[6-size.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)**
* Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file:
    * **[100-intel](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)**
* Write a C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error:
    * **[101-quote.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c)**
